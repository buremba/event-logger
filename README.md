It allows you to capture events triggered by Javascript and log them in developer tools. You can easily track events and export them to JSON to save your actions.
It's useful when you're debugging a web application or writing macros. I'm planning to add load feature to the extension so you can easily export events and load them to programmatically trigger same events.
